3 files containing :
  - SQL requests, the first three (SQL Python) -> "sql_requests"
  - request about artwork aquired during life time (R) -> "r_request"
  - data review + clustering (Python) -> "review_clustering"
  
I also downloaded the csv files of the two tables on Kaggle (it was easier to handle for the optionnal questions).
